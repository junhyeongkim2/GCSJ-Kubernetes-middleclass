# **Create a deployment manifest**

You will create a deployment using a sample deployment manifest called `nginx-deployment.yaml` that has been provided for you. This deployment is configured to run three Pod replicas with a single nginx container in each Pod listening on TCP port 80:

`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-deployment labels: app: nginx spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.7.9 ports: - containerPort: 80`

# **Task 2. Manually scale up and down the number of Pods in deployments**

Sometimes, you want to shut down a Pod instance. Other times, you want ten Pods running. In Kubernetes, you can scale a specific Pod to the desired number of instances. To shut them down, you scale to zero.

In this task, you scale Pods up and down in the Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell.

# **Scale Pods up and down in the console**

1. Switch to the Google Cloud Console tab.
2. On the **Navigation menu** ( ), click **Kubernetes Engine** > **Workloads**.

   [https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D)

3. Click **nginx-deployment** (your deployment) to open the Deployment details page.
4. At the top, click **ACTIONS > Scale**.
5. Type **1** and click **SCALE**.

This action scales down your cluster. You should see the Pod status being updated under **Managed Pods**. You might have to click **Refresh**.

# **Scale Pods up and down in the shell**

1. Switch back to the Cloud Shell browser tab.
2. In the Cloud Shell, to view a list of Pods in the deployments, execute the following command:

`kubectl get deployments`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE nginx-deployment 1/1 1 1 3m`

1. To scale the Pod back up to three replicas, execute the following command:

`kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

1. To view a list of Pods in the deployments, execute the following command:

`kubectl get deployments`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE nginx-deployment 3/3 3 3 4m`

# **Task 3. Trigger a deployment rollout and a deployment rollback**

A deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the deployment's Pod template (that is, `.spec.template`) is changed, for example, if the labels or container images of the template are updated. Other updates, such as scaling the deployment, do not trigger a rollout.

In this task, you trigger deployment rollout, and then you trigger deployment rollback.

# **Trigger a deployment rollout**

1. To update the version of nginx in the deployment, execute the following command:

`kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1 --record`

Copied!

content_copy

This updates the container image in your Deployment to `nginx v1.9.1`.

1. To view the rollout status, execute the following command:

`kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example.

**Output:**

`Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas updated... Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas pending termination... Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas pending termination... deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out`

1. To verify the change, get the list of deployments:

`kubectl get deployments`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example.

**Output:**

`NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE nginx-deployment 3/3 3 3 6m`

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

Update version of nginx in the deployment

**Check my progress**

1. View the rollout history of the deployment:

`kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example. Your output might not be an exact match.

**Output:**

`deployments "nginx-deployment" REVISION CHANGE-CAUSE 1 2 kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1 --record=true`

# Trigger a deployment rollback

To roll back an object's rollout, you can use the `kubectl rollout undo` command.

1. To roll back to the previous version of the nginx deployment, execute the following command:

`kubectl rollout undo deployments nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

1. View the updated rollout history of the deployment:

`kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example. Your output might not be an exact match.

**Output:**

`deployments "nginx-deployment" REVISION CHANGE-CAUSE 2 kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1 --record=true 3`

1. View the details of the latest deployment revision:

`kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment --revision=3`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example. Your output might not be an exact match but it will show that the current revision has rolled back to `nginx:1.7.9`.

**Output:**

`deployments "nginx-deployment" with revision #3 Pod Template: Labels: app=nginx pod-template-hash=3123191453 Containers: nginx: Image: nginx:1.7.9 Port: 80/TCP Host Port: 0/TCP Environment: Mounts: Volumes:`

# **Task 4. Define the service type in the manifest**

In this task, you create and verify a service that controls inbound traffic to an application. Services can be configured as ClusterIP, NodePort or LoadBalancer types. In this lab, you configure a LoadBalancer.

# **Define service types in the manifest**

A manifest file called `service-nginx.yaml` that deploys a LoadBalancer service type has been provided for you. This service is configured to distribute inbound traffic on TCP port 60000 to port 80 on any containers that have the label `app: nginx`.

`apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
app: nginx
ports:

- protocol: TCP
  port: 60000
  targetPort: 80`

Copied!

content_copy

- In the Cloud Shell, to deploy your manifest, execute the following command:

`kubectl apply -f ./service-nginx.yaml`

Copied!

content_copy

This manifest defines a service and applies it to Pods that correspond to the selector. In this case, the manifest is applied to the nginx container that you deployed in task 1. This service also applies to any other Pods with the `app: nginx` label, including any that are created after the service.

# **Verify the LoadBalancer creation**

1. To view the details of the nginx service, execute the following command:

`kubectl get service nginx`

Copied!

content_copy

The output should look like the example.

**Output:**

`NAME CLUSTER_IP EXTERNAL_IP PORT(S) SELECTOR AGE nginx 10.X.X.X X.X.X.X 60000/TCP run=nginx 1m`

1. When the external IP appears, open `http://[EXTERNAL_IP]:60000/` in a new browser tab to see the server being served through network load balancing.

**Note:** It may take a few seconds before the **ExternalIP** field is populated for your service. This is normal. Just re-run the `kubectl get services nginx` command every few seconds until the field is populated.

Deploy manifest file that deploys LoadBalancer service type

**Check my progress**

# **Task 5. Perform a canary deployment**

A canary deployment is a separate deployment used to test a new version of your application. A single service targets both the canary and the normal deployments. And it can direct a subset of users to the canary version to mitigate the risk of new releases.

The manifest file `nginx-canary.yaml` that is provided for you deploys a single pod running a newer version of nginx than your main deployment. In this task, you create a canary deployment using this new deployment file:

`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-canary labels: app: nginx spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx template: metadata: labels: app: nginx track: canary Version: 1.9.1 spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.9.1 ports: - containerPort: 80`

Copied!

content_copy

The manifest for the nginx Service you deployed in the previous task uses a label selector to target the Pods with the `app: nginx` label. Both the normal deployment and this new canary deployment have the `app: nginx` label. Inbound connections will be distributed by the service to both the normal and canary deployment Pods. The canary deployment has fewer replicas (Pods) than the normal deployment, and thus it is available to fewer users than the normal deployment.

1. Create the canary deployment based on the configuration file:

`kubectl apply -f nginx-canary.yaml`

Copied!

content_copy

1. When the deployment is complete, verify that both the nginx and the nginx-canary deployments are present:

`kubectl get deployments`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Switch back to the browser tab that is connected to the external LoadBalancer service ip and refresh the page. You should continue to see the standard `Welcome to nginx` page.
2. Switch back to the Cloud Shell and scale down the primary deployment to 0 replicas:

`kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment nginx-deployment`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Verify that the only running replica is now the Canary deployment:

`kubectl get deployments`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Switch back to the browser tab that is connected to the external LoadBalancer service ip and refresh the page. You should continue to see the standard `Welcome to nginx` page showing that the Service is automatically balancing traffic to the canary deployment.

# **Session affinity**

The service configuration used in the lab does not ensure that all requests from a single client will always connect to the same Pod. Each request is treated separately and can connect to either the normal nginx deployment or to the nginx-canary deployment.

This potential to switch between different versions may cause problems if there are significant changes in functionality in the canary release. To prevent this you can set the `sessionAffinity` field to `ClientIP` in the specification of the service if you need a client's first request to determine which Pod will be used for all subsequent connections.

For example:

`apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
sessionAffinity: ClientIP
selector:
app: nginx
ports:

- protocol: TCP
  port: 60000
  targetPort: 80`
