# Create and apply a manifest with a PVC

Most of the time, you don't need to directly configure PV objects or create Compute Engine persistent disks. Instead, you can create a PVC, and Kubernetes automatically provisions a persistent disk for you.

You create the PVC in this task using the `pvc-demo.yaml` manifest file that has been provided for you. This creates a 30 gigabyte PVC called `hello-web-disk` that can be mounted as a read-write volume on a single node at a time.

`apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: hello-web-disk spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 30Gi`

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command to clone the repository to the lab Cloud Shell:

`git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst`

# **Task 2. Mount and verify Google Cloud persistent disk PVCs in Pods**

In this task, you attach your persistent disk PVC to a Pod. You mount the PVC as a volume as part of the manifest for the Pod.

# Mount the PVC to a Pod

The manifest file `pod-volume-demo.yaml` deploys an nginx container, attaches the `pvc-demo-volume` to the Pod and mounts that volume to the path `/var/www/html` inside the nginx container. Files saved to this directory inside the container will be saved to the persistent volume and persist even if the Pod and the container are shutdown and recreated.

`kind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: pvc-demo-pod spec: containers: - name: frontend image: nginx volumeMounts: - mountPath: "/var/www/html" name: pvc-demo-volume volumes: - name: pvc-demo-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: hello-web-disk`

1. To create the Pod with the volume, execute the following command:

`kubectl apply -f pod-volume-demo.yaml`

Copied!

content_copy

1. List the Pods in the cluster:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pvc-demo-pod 0/1 ContainerCreating 0 18s`

If you do this quickly after creating the Pod, you will see the status listed as "ContainerCreating" while the volume is mounted before the status changes to "Running".

1. To verify the PVC is accessible within the Pod, you must gain shell access to your Pod. To start the shell session, execute the following command:

`kubectl exec -it pvc-demo-pod -- sh`

Copied!

content_copy

1. To create a simple text message as a web page in the Pod enter the following commands:

`echo Test webpage in a persistent volume!>/var/www/html/index.html chmod +x /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Verify the text file contains your message:

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`Test webpage in a persistent volume!`

1. Enter the following command to leave the interactive shell on the nginx container:

`exit`

Copied!

content_copy

# Test the persistence of the PV

You will now delete the Pod from the cluster, confirm that the PV still exists, then redeploy the Pod and verify the contents of the PV remain intact.

1. Delete the pvc-demo-pod:

`kubectl delete pod pvc-demo-pod`

Copied!

content_copy

1. List the Pods in the cluster:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`No resources found in default namespace.`

There should be no Pods on the cluster.

1. To show your PVC, execute the following command:

`kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim`

Copied!

content_copy

**Partial output:**

`NAME STATUS VOLUME CAP ACCESS MODES CLASS AGE hello-web-disk Bound pvc-8...34 30Gi RWO standard 22m`

Your PVC still exists, and was not deleted when the Pod was deleted.

1. Redeploy the pvc-demo-pod:

`kubectl apply -f pod-volume-demo.yaml`

Copied!

content_copy

1. List the Pods in the cluster:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pvc-demo-pod 1/1 Running 0 15s`

The Pod will deploy and the status will change to "Running" faster this time because the PV already exists and does not need to be created.

1. To verify the PVC is still accessible within the Pod, you must gain shell access to your Pod. To start the shell session, execute the following command:

`kubectl exec -it pvc-demo-pod -- sh`

Copied!

content_copy

1. To verify that the text file still contains your message execute the following command:

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`Test webpage in a persistent volume!`

The contents of the persistent volume were not removed, even though the Pod was deleted from the cluster and recreated.

1. Enter the following command to leave the interactive shell on the nginx container:

`exit`

Copied!

# **Task 3. Create StatefulSets with PVCs**

In this task, you use your PVC in a StatefulSet. A StatefulSet is like a Deployment, except that the Pods are given unique identifiers.

# Release the PVC

1. Before you can use the PVC with the statefulset, you must delete the Pod that is currently using it. Execute the following command to delete the Pod:

`kubectl delete pod pvc-demo-pod`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Confirm the Pod has been removed:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`No resources found in default namespace.`

# Create a StatefulSet

The manifest file `statefulset-demo.yaml` creates a StatefulSet that includes a LoadBalancer service and three replicas of a Pod containing an nginx container and a volumeClaimTemplate for 30 gigabyte PVCs with the name `hello-web-disk`. The nginx containers mount the PVC called `hello-web-disk` at `/var/www/html` as in the previous task.

`kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: statefulset-demo-service
spec:
ports:

- protocol: TCP
  port: 80
  targetPort: 9376

volumeClaimTemplates:

- metadata:
  name: hello-web-disk
  spec:
  accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
  resources:
  requests:
  storage: 30Gi`

- To create the StatefulSet with the volume, execute the following command:

`kubectl apply -f statefulset-demo.yaml`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`service "statefulset-demo-service" created statefulset.apps "statefulset-demo" created`

You now have a statefulset running behind a service named `statefulset-demo-service`.

# Verify the connection of Pods in StatefulSets

1. Use "kubectl describe" to view the details of the StatefulSet:

`kubectl describe statefulset statefulset-demo`

Copied!

content_copy

Note the event status at the end of the output. The service and statefulset created successfully.

`Normal SuccessfulCreate 10s statefulset-controller Message: create Claim hello-web-disk-statefulset-demo-0 Pod statefulset-demo-0 in StatefulSet statefulset-demo success Normal SuccessfulCreate 10s statefulset-controller Message: create Pod statefulset-demo-0 in StatefulSet statefulset-demo successful`

1. List the Pods in the cluster:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE statefulset-demo-0 1/1 Running 0 6m statefulset-demo-1 1/1 Running 0 3m statefulset-demo-2 1/1 Running 0 2m`

1. To list the PVCs, execute the following command:

`kubectl get pvc`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS hello-web-disk Bound pvc-86117ea6-...34 30Gi RWO hello-web-disk-st...-demo-0 Bound pvc-92d21d0f-...34 30Gi RWO hello-web-disk-st...-demo-1 Bound pvc-9bc84d92-...34 30Gi RWO hello-web-disk-st...-demo-2 Bound pvc-a526ecdf-...34 30Gi RWO`

The original hello-web-disk is still there and you can now see the individual PVCs that were created for each Pod in the new statefulset Pod.

1. Use "kubectl describe" to view the details of the first PVC in the StatefulSet:

`kubectl describe pvc hello-web-disk-statefulset-demo-0`

Copied!

# **Task 4. Verify the persistence of Persistent Volume connections to Pods managed by StatefulSets**

In this task, you verify the connection of Pods in StatefulSets to particular PVs as the Pods are stopped and restarted.

1. To verify that the PVC is accessible within the Pod, you must gain shell access to your Pod. To start the shell session, execute the following command:

`kubectl exec -it statefulset-demo-0 -- sh`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Verify that there is no `index.html` text file in the `/var/www/html` directory:

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

1. To create a simple text message as a web page in the Pod enter the following commands:

`echo Test webpage in a persistent volume!>/var/www/html/index.html chmod +x /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Verify the text file contains your message:

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`Test webpage in a persistent volume!`

1. Enter the following command to leave the interactive shell on the nginx container:

`exit`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Delete the Pod where you updated the file on the PVC:

`kubectl delete pod statefulset-demo-0`

Copied!

content_copy

1. List the Pods in the cluster:

`kubectl get pods`

Copied!

content_copy

You will see that the StatefulSet is automatically restarting the `statefulset-demo-0` Pod.

**Note:** You need to wait until the Pod status shows that it is running again.

1. Connect to the shell on the new `statefulset-demo-0` Pod:

`kubectl exec -it statefulset-demo-0 -- sh`

Copied!

content_copy

1. Verify that the text file still contains your message:

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

Copied!

content_copy

**Output:**

`Test webpage in a persistent volume!`

The StatefulSet restarts the Pod and reconnects the existing dedicated PVC to the new Pod, ensuring that the data for that Pod is preserved.

1. Enter the following command to leave the interactive shell on the nginx container:

`exit`
